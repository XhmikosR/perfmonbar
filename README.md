## Notes

* You will have to edit the default [`config.xml`](https://github.com/XhmikosR/perfmonbar/blob/main/src/config.xml) to match your system.
* The default `config.xml` will **not** work for **non-English** systems. You have to adjust the config file, see below.
* For the known issues see [issues](https://github.com/XhmikosR/perfmonbar/issues).

## Configuration

The `config.xml` file must be adapted in the following cases:

* You have a non-English Windows system running. The search strings in the `config.xml` file must be adapted to the language of the operating system, otherwise the corresponding strings will not be found by Perfmonbar and nothing will be displayed in the taskbar.
* You want to display other information in the taskbar. To do this, you have to find the appropriate and available strings and change them in the `config.xml` file.
* You want to change the appearance of the information in the taskbar. To do this, you need to change the corresponding properties in the `config.xml` file.

### Where is the `config.xml` file?

Usually, the `config.xml` file can be found under:

```text
C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\PerfmonBar\config.xml
```

To quickly get to the directory, you can simply type `%APPDATA%\PerfmonBar`.

### How to find the desired settings?

Open a console and run the command `typeperf -q > counters.txt`

Then you can search the file `counters.txt` for the desired performance counters that are available on your computer. The counters are unfortunately called differently in every single language.
